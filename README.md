# 24notes
Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogiEwbC8maw 

Motivation: Came across this YouTube video explaining how a 24-note octave provides a wider palette for expressing music. Wanted to visualise how it sounds in comparisono to the standard 12-note octave prevalent today.

Objective: Develop a program that generates & plays the 12-note(basic octave) and 24-note(advanced variation with micro-tones) octave system prevalent in Indian Classical Music, taking the tonic freq as the input and displays the relative ratios and frequencies of each note.

The user inputs the tonic/base frequency or the Western Scale in which he intends to listen to the micro-tones.

The input frequency is used to calculate each note in the 12-note and 24-note octaves as per pre-defined ratios sourced from formal Indian Music literature references.

Using sine wave generation to generate pure tones, these ratios and precise frequencies are then displayed along with the audio, enabling the user to clearly differentiate each micro-tone, identify the relative positions of each note and observe the difference by listening to the output audio.
