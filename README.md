Demo of the 24-note octave in Indian Classical Music

Motivation: a para abt the Indian 12 note system, micro-tonalities, 24 notes mentioned in theory, how its similar in other world music with regional changes and influences. My intention of demo-ing the 24 notes as its almost non-existent in present day Indian music and difficult to understand the concept, potentially aiding music students and researchers.

Objective: Develop a program that generates & plays the 12-note(basic octave) and 24-note(advanced variation with micro-tones) octave system prevalent in Indian Classical Music, taking the tonic freq as the input and displays the relative ratios and frequencies of each note.

The user inputs the tonic/base frequency or the Western Scale in which he intends to listen to the micro-tones.

The input frequency is used to calculate each note in the 12-note and 24-note octaves as per pre-defined ratios sourced from formal Indian Music literature references.

Using sine wave generation to generate pure tones, these ratios and precise frequencies are then displayed along with the audio, enabling the user to clearly differentiate each micro-tone, identify the relative positions of each note and observe the difference by listening to the output audio.
